# Simple-Weather-App
A weather app that utilizes an API to fetch weather data provides users with up-to-date weather information for their desired locations. The app uses an Application Programming Interface (API) to connect to a remote weather service, retrieving real-time or forecasted weather data.
User Interface: The weather app features a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input their desired location or use their device's GPS to detect their current location automatically.

1. API Integration:
The app is integrated with a weather API service. The API acts as a bridge between the app and the weather data provider's servers. Through this API, the app can make requests and receive weather-related information.

2. Weather Data Retrieval: 
When the user enters a location or grants access to their GPS, the app sends a request to the weather API with the corresponding location data. The API then processes the request and returns relevant weather data back to the app.

4. Displaying Weather Information: 
The app presents the received weather data in a clear and easily understandable format. Typical information includes current weather conditions .
